OneStep Authentication System


Introduction
OneStep is an advanced multi-layered authentication and identity verification system designed to deliver secure and seamless access to digital platforms. The system integrates various authentication methods, such as social logins, passcodes, and biometric authentication (FaceID and TouchID) via WebAuthn technology.

Additionally, OneStep provides features like device management, KYC/AML compliance, and an auto-verification system (AVV) to safeguard user accounts against fraud, hacking, and malicious activities.

OneStep's robust ecosystem serves as the foundation for secure transactions, user verification, and fraud prevention across blockchain-integrated platforms.

Key Features
1. Social Login Integration: Use Telegram for seamless account sign-in and sign-up.
2. Passcode Creation: Users create unique, secure passcodes validated by the AVV system.
3. Biometric Authentication: Enable FaceID or TouchID authentication via WebAuthn.
4. Device Management: Register up to 5 devices for account access control.
5. Security Monitoring: Detect and respond to unauthorized activities in real-time.
6. KYC/AML Compliance: Ensure regulatory compliance with ID verification.
7. Auto-Verification System (AVV): Validate passcodes and biometric inputs automatically.
8. Single Sign-On (SSO): Use OS-IDs for seamless access across multiple dApps.
